# The Problem Statement:
A company wants to know and automate the process that which customers or applicant should be given the loans for buying a house.
# Project Description
A house loan dataset was given to make a House Loan Approval prediction. Currently, In approval process customers first apply for the home loan and after that company validates the customer's eligibility based on different parameters asked in Home Loan approval form. These parameters are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others. Now, the company wants to automate the loan eligibility process in real-time based on the customer detail provided while filling online application form. It is a Binary Classification problem where we have to predict whether a loan would be approved or not. In a classification problem, we have to predict the discrete values based on a given set of independent variable(s).In this project we will identify the best algorithm by comparing the results of different classification algorithms for Home Loan approval prediction where based on the parameters applicant will get there loan approved/disapproved and accordingly company will focus only on the approved customers.
# The Hypothesis Generation:
Below are some points which I think may affect the application,
1.	Lower the loan amount will increase the chances of getting loan approved.
2.	People who has business has less chances to get their home loan approved.
3.	Those applicant who has higher income will have higher chances of getting their loan approved.
4.	Females applicants have better chance of getting loan approved.
5.	Married applicant will have the lower chances of getting loan approved.
6.	Applicants who are buying property in urban areas will easily get loan approved.
7.	Co-applicant with higher income will increase the chances of getting loan approved for main applicant.
8.	Loan for less time period should have higher chances of approval.
9.	Applicants who have repaid their previous debts should have higher chances of loan approval.
# Possible Outcome
1.	Generally males got their loan approved easily.
2.	Applicant who are buying property in Semi-Urban area will easily get their loan approved.
